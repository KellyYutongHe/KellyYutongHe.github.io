I am a forth-year PhD student in the Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by <a href="https://zicokolter.com/">Prof. Zico Kolter</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/">Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov</a>.

Before coming to CMU, I was a master's student at Stanford Computer Science with distinction in research. I was advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/">Prof. Stefano Ermon</a>, and closely worked with <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/">Prof. Christopher Manning</a>,  <a href="https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell">Prof. David Lobell</a> and  <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/">Prof. Marshall Burke</a>. I completed my B.S in Mathematics and B.S. in Data Science with highest distinction at University of Rochester, where I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/">Prof. Henry Kautz</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/">Prof. Jiebo Luo</a>.  

I was selected as a <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/thedish/2020/10/08/16-stanford-graduate-students-named-2021-siebel-scholars/">Siebel Scholar</a> and a Xerox Engineering Research Fellow. I was also awarded an <a href="https://blog.iclr.cc/2022/04/20/announcing-the-iclr-2022-outstanding-paper-award-recipients/">Outstanding Paper Award at ICLR 2022</a> and Doris Ermine Smith Award for Achievement in Mathematics.

My research interests include generative models (more specifically controllable generation), representation learning, computational sustainability and broad deep learning topics in general.
